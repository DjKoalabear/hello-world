Going to attempt to create a new branch and then merge it back to the master branch. I think that's the flow. I'm not sure. I'll find out soon enough.

Definitely not the best README.md file but it's a start. I'll get better at this. 
```

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4

#make a request to the website  and get the content
r=requests.get('https://www.google.com')
r.content

# use the 'html.parser' to parse the page

soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

# find the data to extract

data = soup.find_all('quantum physics research', class_= 'example')

#extract and print all data it finds

for item in data:
  print(item)
```
```python

```
```python
